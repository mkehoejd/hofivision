HOFIvision is a message aggregation app that consolidates messages from multiple platforms (e.g., Facebook Messenger, Instagram DMs, Gmail, etc.) into a unified interface for user convenience. Your privacy and data security are our top priorities.

⸻

1. Data Collection

We collect only the data required to deliver messages to and from your connected platforms, including:
	•	Sender ID
	•	Message content
	•	Timestamps

We do not collect or store your credentials. OAuth tokens provided by Facebook/Instagram are stored locally or securely in your environment.

⸻

2. How We Use Data
	•	Display your messages in a terminal-style interface
	•	Enable you to respond through connected APIs
	•	Support basic message routing (e.g., inbox filters, responses)

We do not use your data for marketing, analytics, or resale. We do not send your data to third parties.

⸻

3. Third-Party APIs

We integrate with Facebook Graph API, Instagram Messaging API, Gmail API (planned), and other services you explicitly connect.

These platforms have their own privacy policies. By using HOFIvision, you acknowledge their terms.

⸻

4. Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device unless explicitly configured otherwise (e.g., cloud sync via your infrastructure).

We do not operate servers or store message content outside your machine.

⸻

5. Your Rights

You may disconnect your accounts or uninstall the app at any time. Since we do not maintain user accounts, we retain no personal data after disconnection.
